examples for making bash web GUI's

THis is just a bunch of junk I collected to help make web GUI's with bash.  It uses netcat, bash, and some html.  Its mostly a hack of junk I've found online...  but I'm mostly a hack so its fititng.  For input it basically just grabs the attributes from html forms and passes them to a bash script.  For output it basically just autogenerates HTML in a bash script and displays it.  Super simple stuff.  I'm sure others have done it...  I just havent seen any tutorials online so when I brain-farted this together I figured I'd make a project out of it.

It doesnt work on mac...  something to do with regex?  and on some linux installations it won't do iframes
